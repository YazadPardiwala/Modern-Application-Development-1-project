Below are the instructions to run this blog_lite application.

Ensure that the file 'main.py', and folders '.idea', 'application', 'static', 'templates', and 'venv' are all extracted/copied to the same root folder (so that their relative paths stay the same).

Run the main.py file, either directly via command line or by opening it in an ide and running it from there. 
In either case, once run it should tell you the port the app is runnning on & the url via which login page is to be
accessed.

While unlikely, there is a chance that following extraction the app chooses the wrong python interpretor/does not choose one at all. 
This may lead to a 'Module Not Found' error or a 'No python at {directory for what it thinks is the local interpretor}'.
In such a case, open the main.py file with an ide, and use said ide to selectt the 'venv' folder for
the local python interpretor.

And voila the app is running.
